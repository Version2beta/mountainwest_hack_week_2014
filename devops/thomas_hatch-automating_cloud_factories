Thomas Hatch, SaltStack founder and CTO, @thatch45

Thomas Hatch is the primary author of SaltStack.

Third most active merger of pull requests on Github last year. 800 active developers.

"Salt's like puppet or chef", "Salt's a remote control thing", and "Salt's like a cloud thing". All true.

Speed

* Flexible and pluggable
* based on 0MQ
* SSH
* RAET

Imperative and declarative

* Finite order execution
* YAML or Python DSL or JSON

Cloud

* Salt Virt
* Database free
* Evolving
* Agent is called a 'minion'

"Don't have pets, have cattle." Seems to have something to do with the amount of coddling and the return on investment

Hardware

* Server infrastruct
* Network devices
* Storage
* Client devices

Software

* Any private or public cloud
* Virtual machines
* Applications and application containers
* etcd
