* Culture
* Automation
* Metrics
* Sharing

Been around a while!

VIDS:

* Value realignment - watch the value flow through the organization. It's not developers if the servers aren't answering.
* Individuality - Cynefin Sense Making Framework
* Don't be an asshole - TCA Total Cost of Asshole $160k per year
* Self-awareness, systems thinking

Value realignment - Automation & Sharing
Individuality - Metrics and Sharing
Self Awareness - Culture
Don't be an Asshole - Culture

Read the phoenix project?

What's next?

* flow, ops-flow? enterprise devops? unicorns and rainbows?
* Whatever it is, it'll be VIDS.
