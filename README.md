# Mountain West Hack Week

This are simply my notes from Mountain West Javascript, Devops, and Ruby, March 16 - 21, 2014 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

Hack Week went a week, as you might surmise from the name. I did not pay attention to every talk, nor did I even attend every talk. So some of my notes are disappointing. You've been warned.
