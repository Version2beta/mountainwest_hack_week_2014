# Nerd Party v3.1

Ryan Davis, Seattle.rb, @the_zenspider

User and study groups

Weekly, centrally located, consistent location, unstructured hacking.

Some people feel intimidated by the format.

Some people don't see the value without presentations.

So they made v3.0:

Weekly and monthly format. Once a month, presentations. Other weeks are hackfest.

v3.1:

Adds weekly study group. SICP, Realm of Racket, Nand to Tetris, etc. Real homework.

Recipe:

* Food and drink win, but participants are more passive
