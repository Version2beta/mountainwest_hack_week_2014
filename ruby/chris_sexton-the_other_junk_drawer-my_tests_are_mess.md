# The other junk drawer: My tests are a mess

Complex - a high number of components in a system.

Complicated - a high level of difficulty.

Strive for a high number of components in the system, each of which are easy to understand.

Acceptance tests: Keep the business happy.

Unit tests. Sandi Metz. http://bit.ly/sandi-wizard

In-between: Controllers. Views. Requests.

Classic testing pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

Testing advice

* Make your test folder mirror your ./lib directory.
* Group logically, putting related things close together.
* Manage the setup very carefully.
