## Patterns

"Transition between the street and the front door"

Patterns contain patterns

Principles are patterns. DRY, YAGNI, SRP Single Responsibility Principle, OCP Open/Closed Principle, LSP Liskov Substituion Principle (Design By Principle), DIP Dependency Inversion Principle.


## Architecture



## Anti-patterns

Welcome to negative town.

Law of demeter applies.

Fat models.

DIV-itis
PHP-itis
JAVA-isms

Typographic refactoring is good.

Fat controllers.

## Application

Design patterns are suggested approaches seen in the wild.

"Patterns, like all forms of complexity, should be avoided until they are absolutely necessary." Jeff Atwood

Not about using the patterns, it's about speaking the language.

"The quality of a space that has no name."
