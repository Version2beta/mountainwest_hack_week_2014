# A Magical Gathering

Aaron Patterson, @tenderlove

* What do I have?
* Is it any good?
* How much is it worth?

He was talking about his 5000+ Magic The Gathering cards, but maybe it's related to Ruby?

Ruby has promises? `Promise = Thread`. Sweet!!

libphash perceptual hashing in Ruby (phashion?)

Hamming distance - perceptual hashing difference between two images

Aaron extended SQLLite3 to include hamming distance in the database

Unlock the GIL? Aaron did.

Some image recognition stuff

* Canny edge detector
* Find countours to find what's not a hole. What's a hole? It's a contour that's inside the outer contour.
* Find the largest contour (library does it by area)
* Use a warp matrix to transform the card.
* Use ROI Region of Interest for capturing just the image of the card.
