## Clustering

K-Means Clustering

* Group anything that can be plotted on an X-Y chart
* Marker-cluster example is good to look at

## Classifiers

### Bayesian

### Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)

* Analyze text to identify the topic
* PostgreSQL - LS Vector

## Recommending

### Jaccard Index

* How similar or different are these data?

* https://github.com/davidcelis/recommendable
* PostgreSQL pg_similarity (jaccard?)
