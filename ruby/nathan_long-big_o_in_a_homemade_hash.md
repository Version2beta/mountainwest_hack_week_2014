# Big O in a homemade hash

Nathan Long, @sleeplessgeek

In an array of arrays...

Big O:
    * O is for order, like order of growth
    * O(1) number of elements is not relevant
    * Orders of growth can describe how an algorithm scales
    * Shape, not location or angle
    * Traveling salesman problem

Access by index is O(1)

Digest function figure out where to put something in an array.
