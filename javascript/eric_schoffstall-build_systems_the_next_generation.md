# Build systems: the next generation

Build systems

* file based approach - read, concat, minify, write
* task based approach - read, concat, write, read, minify, write

File based approach is based on streams. Task based approach is based on functions.

Gulp is file based. Files are read one time and written one time.

Gulp has tons of plugins. Most anything you wanna do is available as a plugin. http://gulpjs.com/plugins
